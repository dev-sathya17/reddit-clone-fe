# Reddit Clone – Frontend 🧱

This is the **frontend** for a full-featured Reddit clone built as a large-scale, full-stack pet project.  
The goal is to **replicate Reddit’s core features** with a modern tech stack and clean architectural patterns.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Build a production-grade, modular, Reddit-like web app
- Learn and apply patterns like **GraphQL**, **microservices**, **caching**, **CI/CD**, and more
- Keep frontend and backend separated for better collaboration and deployment
- Explore performance, scalability, and maintainability principles in real-world architecture

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** – lightning-fast dev build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling
- **TanStack Query** – smart and optimized data fetching layer
- **Apollo Client** – for GraphQL queries & mutations
- **GraphQL Gateway** (coming soon – connects to backend microservices)
